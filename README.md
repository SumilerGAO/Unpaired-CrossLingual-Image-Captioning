# UNISON: Unpaired Cross-Lingual Image Captioning

For testing our final model, please run
```python
    python eval_gan.py;
```

For downloading the dictionaries, encoded features and well-trained models, please find them from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18tSNvcUU79aySd6MWV3j_zwx7dC6KVuT?usp=sharing). 

For examples of filtered translation corpus, senetence scene graphs before and after augmentation, etc., please find them from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1FuO5TzI8HX7fDMna9WrWJNw2dUkwVSgQ).

More details will be updated to README.md later. 

Thanks.
